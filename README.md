This repo has few website's landing page clone created with html and css. I created this for my learning and practice purpose. 
While I was building this clone I encounter several problems but I was able to overcome them. During the time when I was 
watching tutorial on youtube I get to know a lot but even so when I landed on vscode and tried to build these clones I realise 
that most of the learing comes from doing the work writing the code line by line.
